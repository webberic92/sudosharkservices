        $SIMON is the ERC-20 token that powers the economy of The Buddha Inu Community.
        $SIMON will be at the center of transacting and benefiting from new utility and functionality being rolled out to deliver value to the community.
        For our upcoming collection launches, $SIMON token owners will be given access to exclusive perks including NFT's and discounts.
        The ONLY way to earn $SIMON is by purchasing in ICO, staking $SIMON, and staking The Buddha Inu NFT's. The ICO will be in tiered systems with the price starting lower and increasing as times goes on until sold out.

        <u> End Goal</u>
      </h5> -->
      <!-- <p>
        The goal for this economy is to raise capital to create a P2E game where
        The BuddhaInu  NFTs will serve as avatars in the game.<br />
        With this capital we plan to invest in upcoming technologies in
        metaverse lands such as NFT Worlds, The Sandbox, etc...<br />
        This is not limited to vitural assets but also to real world assets such
        as investing in properties and businesses where capital will be
        reinvested into the projects and returned as dividends to holders.<br />
        SIMON will be needed to enter our metaverse and play the game. Where
        The BuddhaInu  NFT holders will represent a fraction of game ownerhsip.

        Once the ICO is over, the only way to continue to purchase SIMON will be
        on a DEX or by staking. <br />
        Currently staking is set to 5.09% a year. (Which is equivalent to 5% a
        year compounded quarterly.)<br />
        This is based on a year being 31,536,000 seconds, excluding leap
        years.
